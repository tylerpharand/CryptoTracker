# CryptoTracker
Cryptocurrency tracker for iOS.

<b>Note:</b> App is still in progress. I wish to add additional functionality for adding/tracking arbitrary coins based on their symbol identifier. I'd also like to generate icons for coins which do not have an image file. I must implment a plist file for storing/loading user settings.

- Build with Swift.
- Makes use of CryptoCompare API: https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/
